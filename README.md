- üîç Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- üöÄ RESTful API architecture
- üíæ MySQL database integration
- üõ†Ô∏è Modern tech stack (Spring Boot 3.5, React 19, Vite 7)

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.5.3
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Database
- Lombok for boilerplate reduction
- Maven for dependency management

### Frontend
- React 19.1.0
- Vite 7.0.4
- Bootstrap 5.3.7
- Axios for API communication
- React Router v7
- ESLint for code quality

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Node.js 18.x or later
- MySQL 8.x
- Maven 3.6+

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atharvashirodkar/library-management-system.git
   cd library-management-system/lms-backend
   ```

2. Configure MySQL database:
   - Create a database named 'library_db'
   - Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MySQL credentials

3. Build and run the backend:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ./mvnw spring:run
   ```
   The backend server will start on http://localhost:8080

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../lms-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend application will be available at http://localhost:5173

## API Documentation
